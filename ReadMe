PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 modules named "Data::MultiValuedHash" and 
"CGI::MultiValuedHash".

All of my modules have complete POD inside of them, so please refer to that for a
description of the module itself.

This Read Me document concerns itself mainly with installation and support
issues, and also includes any "To Do" lists and the file manifest.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

REQUIREMENTS

All of my modules require Perl 5.004 or newer, even though only some of them need
it, in the interest of consistency.

INSTALLATION

I haven't gotten around to doing makefiles, so you will have to install these the
old fashioned way, by copying.  The files "Data/MultiValuedHash.pm" and
"CGI/MultiValuedHash.pm" go inside the "Data" and "CGI" folders respectively,
which are in the "lib" folder that came with your Perl 5 distribution.  Or
alternately, put them anywhere you want, but you will need to have that location
added to your include path by your main program using something like this:

	use lib '/users/me/www_files/lib';

Any existing POD is embedded in the module itself, so you will have to look there
to see it, or run a POD extractor on it yourself, or look at the copy on CPAN
that is dutifully extracted and turned to HTML.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.

TO DO

	* Add a Make File to the distribution.
	* Add testing scripts.
	* Allow changing of "ignores case" attribute without reinitializing
	* Add a splice function, which is noticeably absent.
	* Add a method like scan() to allow custom processing of the 
	content using a passed in code ref.
	* Add a method or three to export a human-readable list of 
	the structure's contents, in html and/or plain text.

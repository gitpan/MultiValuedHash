	* Release 1.05.
	
	* Added method splice() to Data::MultiValuedHash so as to round out the set 
	of standard array manipulation functions.
	
	* Added static function batch_new() to Data::HashOfArrays which emulates the 
	symantecs of calling new() multiple times with a list of initializers; as 
	many new MVH objects are made as there are elements in the list.
	
	* Added programmer documentation to the private method 
	_reduce_hash_from_subset() so people know how to use this method.  Due to its 
	private nature, it is not covered in the POD.
	
	* Added static functions batch_to_file() and batch_from_file() to 
	CGI::MultiValuedHash so that an entire list of MVH objects can be written to 
	or read from a file at once.  Symantecs are similar to calling the to_file() 
	and from_file() methods.  batch_from_file() will read to the end of the file 
	by default, but can be restricted by an argument to stop after a certain 
	number of objects are retrieved.

	* Release 1.04.
	
	* This release is the first one that includes the CPAN standard files 
	"Makefile.PL" and "MANIFEST", which were all created following 
	the previous release.  The content of "Manifest" was previously inside the 
	"ReadMe" file.  Improved the install instructions in my ReadMe file.
	
	* Added a hook to the initialize() method in Data::MultiValuedHash for 
	handling initializers that aren't hashes.  CGI::MultiValuedHash now uses 
	that hook for handling more initializer types, rather than overloading all 
	of initialize().
	
	* Many small changes were made to methods in Data::MultiValuedHash so that 
	they work better or the code is more readable.
	
	* Added "Method Relationship Overview" section to the POD of Data::MVH.
	
	* Changed the ignores_case() method so that you can now change that property.
	When changing this property from false to true, any existing keys are 
	lowercased, which can not be reversed (except from a backup).
	
	* Added method fetch_hash() to Data::MVH which returns a hash containing 
	all of the keys and one for each; values are all taken from the array 
	index specified with an argument.  fetch_first() and fetch_last() have 
	been changed to use this to implement themselves, since they are the same 
	except with implicit indexes of 0 or -1.
	
	* Added INDEXES argument to fetch() and fetch_all() so that a caller can 
	restrict a range of values to be returned for each key, much as the KEYS 
	argument of some methods restrict which keys are returned; the new argument
	does not have a COMPLEMENT modifier, however. 
	
	* Added a method to CGI::MultiValuedHash for outputting the object's keys 
	and values in an HTML table.

	* Release 1.03.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entries would look like this:
	
Data::
::MultiValuedHash bdpO Hash whose keys have multiple ordered values DUNCAND

CGI::
::MultiValuedHash bdpO Store and manipulate url-encoded data        DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains my "Data::MultiValuedHash" and "CGI::MultiValuedHash" 
	modules, which were previously a part of the following distributions 
	under the temporary name of "CGI::HashOfArrays":
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26
	
	* These modules require Perl version 5.004.

	* Code changes since CGI::HashOfArrays consist mainly in its separation into 
	two modules, named above.  This took care of a longstanding logistical 
	problem concerning whether the module was a generic data structure 
	or a tool for encoding/decoding CGI data.  The CGI:: module is a subclass of 
	the Data:: module, so you can use it like you used the old module.
	Thanks to Johan Vromans <jvromans@squirrel.nl> for suggesting the split.
	
	* The POD also received significant updates.  Thanks to Steve Benson 
	<steve.benson@stanford.edu> for suggesting improvements to initialize().
	
	* Added method store_value() to Data::MultiValuedHash.
	
2000-12-26   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* CGI-FormGenerator 0.9201, the last version of any distribution to include
CGI::HashOfArrays, was released.
	
2000-07-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.0, the first version of any distribution to include
CGI::HashOfArrays, was released on CPAN.
	
2000-04-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Completed primary development on this module.

2000-01-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the final version of this module.
	
	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07-29 thru 1999-11-13

	* Worked on prototype of code that ended up in this module.

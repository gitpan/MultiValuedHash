	* Release 1.03.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entries would look like this:
	
Data::
::MultiValuedHash bdpO Hash whose keys have multiple ordered values DUNCAND

CGI::
::MultiValuedHash bdpO Store and manipulate url-encoded data        DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains my "Data::MultiValuedHash" and "CGI::MultiValuedHash" 
	modules, which were previously a part of the following distributions 
	under the temporary name of "CGI::HashOfArrays":
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26
	
	* These modules require Perl version 5.004 (although 5.0 may work).

	* Code changes since CGI::HashOfArrays consist mainly in its separation into 
	two modules, named above.  This took care of a longstanding logistical 
	problem concerning whether the module was a generic data structure 
	or a tool for encoding/decoding CGI data.  The CGI:: module is a subclass of 
	the Data:: module, so you can use it like you used the old module.
	Thanks to Johan Vromans <jvromans@squirrel.nl> for suggesting the split.
	
	* The POD also received significant updates.  Thanks to Steve Benson 
	<steve.benson@stanford.edu> for suggesting improvements to initialize().
	
	* Added method store_value() to Data::MultiValuedHash.
